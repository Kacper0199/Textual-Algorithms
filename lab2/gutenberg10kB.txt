  PARODIES

  OF THE WORKS OF

  ENGLISH AND AMERICAN AUTHORS,

  COLLECTED AND ANNOTATED BY

  WALTER HAMILTON,

  _Fellow of the Royal Geographical and Royal Historical Societies;

Æsthetic Movement in England,” etc._

                                ――――

  “We maintain that, far from converting virtue into a paradox, and
degrading truth by ridicule, PARODY will only strike at what
is chimerical and false; it is not a piece of buffoonery so much as a
critical exposition. What do we parody but the absurdities of writers,
who frequently; make their heroes act against nature, common-sense,
and truth? After all, it is the public, not we, who are the authors of
these PARODIES.

  _All these things here collected are not mine,
   But divers grapes make but one kind of wine;
   So I from many learned authors took
   The various matters written in this book;
   What’s not mine own shall not by me be fathered,
   The most   part I, in many years, have gathered._
                                       JOHN TAYLOR, the Water Poet.


  “_It was because Homer was the most popular poet, that he was most
  susceptible of the playful honours of the Greek parodist; unless
  the prototype is familiar to us, a parody is nothing._”
