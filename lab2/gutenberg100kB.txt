  OF THE WORKS OF

Æsthetic Movement in England,” etc._

                                ――――

  “We maintain that, far from converting virtue into a paradox, and
degrading truth by ridicule, PARODY will only strike at what
is chimerical and false; it is not a piece of buffoonery so much as a
critical exposition. What do we parody but the absurdities of writers,
who frequently; make their heroes act against nature, common-sense,
and truth? After all, it is the public, not we, who are the authors of
these PARODIES.

  _All these things here collected are not mine,
   But divers grapes make but one kind of wine;
   So I from many learned authors took
   The various matters written in this book;
   What’s not mine own shall not by me be fathered,
   The most   part I, in many years, have gathered._
                                       JOHN TAYLOR, the Water Poet.


  “_It was because Homer was the most popular poet, that he was most
  susceptible of the playful honours of the Greek parodist; unless
  the prototype is familiar to us, a parody is nothing._”

A CHAPTER ON PARODIES.


A lady of _bas bleu_ celebrity (the term is getting odious,
particularly to our _savantes_) had two friends, whom she equally
admired――an elegant poet, and his parodist. She had contrived to
prevent their meeting as long as her stratagems lasted, till at length
she apologised to the serious bard for inviting him when his mock
_umbra_ was to be present. Astonished, she perceived that both men of
genius felt a mutual esteem for each other’s opposite talent; the
ridiculed had perceived no malignity in the playfulness of the parody,
and even seemed to consider it as a compliment, aware that parodists
do not waste their talent on obscure productions; while the ridiculer
himself was very sensible that he was the inferior poet. The
lady-critic had imagined that PARODY must necessarily be malicious;
and in some cases it is said those on whom the parody has been
performed, have been of the same opinion.

PARODY strongly resembles mimicry, a principle in human nature not so
artificial as it appears. Man may well be defined a mimetic animal.
The African boy who amused the whole kafle he journeyed with, by
mimicking the gestures and the voice of the auctioneer who had sold
him at the slave market a few days before, could have had no sense of
scorn, of superiority, or of malignity; the boy experienced merely the
pleasure of repeating attitudes and intonations which had so forcibly
excited his interest. The numerous parodies of Hamlet’s soliloquy were
never made in derision of that solemn monologue, no more than the
travesties of Virgil by Scarron and Cotton; their authors were never
so gaily mad as that. We have parodies on the Psalms by Luther;
Dodsley parodied the book of Chronicles, and Franklin’s most beautiful
story of Abraham is a parody on the Scripture-style; not one of these
writers, however, proposed to ridicule their originals; some ingenuity
in the application was all that they intended. The lady-critic alluded
to had suffered by a panic, in imagining that a parody was necessarily
a corrosive satire. Had she indeed proceeded one step further, and
asserted that PARODIES might be classed among the most malicious
inventions in literature, in such parodies as Colman and Lloyd made on
Gray’s odes, in their odes to “Oblivion and Obscurity,” her readings
possibly might have supplied the materials of the present research.

PARODIES were frequently practised by the ancients, and with them,
like ourselves, consisted of a work grafted on another work, but which
turned on a different subject by a slight change of the expressions.
It might be a sport of fancy, the innocent child of mirth; or a
satirical arrow drawn from the quiver of caustic criticism; or it was
that malignant art which only studies to make the original of the
parody, however beautiful, contemptible and ridiculous. Human nature
thus enters into the composition of parodies, and their variable
character originates in the purpose of their application.

There is in “the million” a natural taste for farce after tragedy, and
they gladly relieve themselves by mitigating the solemn seriousness of
the tragic drama; for they find, as one of them told us, that it is
but a step from the sublime to the ridiculous; and if this taste be
condemned by the higher order of intellectual persons, and a critic
said he would prefer to have the farce played before the tragedy, the
taste for parody would be still among them, for whatever tends to
level a work of genius is usually very agreeable to a great number of
contemporaries. In the history of PARODIES, some of the learned have
noticed a supposititious circumstance, which it is not improbable
happened, for it is a very natural one. When the rhapsodists, who
strolled from town to town to chant different fragments of the poems
of Homer, and had recited some, they were immediately followed by
another set of strollers――buffoons who made the same audience merry by
the burlesque turn which they gave to the solemn strains which had
just so deeply engaged their attention. It is supposed that we have
one of these travesties of the Iliad in one Sotades, who succeeded by
only changing the measure of the verses without altering the words,
which entirely disguised the Homeric character; fragments of which are
scattered in Dionysius Halicarnassensis, which I leave to the
curiosity of the learned Grecian.[1] Homer’s battle of the Frogs and
Mice, a learned critic, the elder Heinsius, asserts, was not written
by the poet, but is a parody on the poem. It is evidently as good
humoured an one as any in the “Rejected Addresses.” And it was because
Homer was the most popular poet, that he was most susceptible of the
playful honours of the parodist; unless the prototype is familiar to
us, a parody is nothing! Of these parodists of Homer we may regret the
loss of one. Timon of Philius, whose parodies were termed Silli, from
Silenus being their chief personage; he levelled them at the
sophistical philosophers of his age: his invocation is grafted on the
opening of the Iliad, to recount the evil doings of those babblers,
whom he compares to those bags in which Æolus deposited all his winds;
balloons inflated with empty ideas! We should like to have
appropriated some of these _silli_, or parodies of Timon the
Sillograph, which, however, seem to have been at times calumnious.[2]
Shenstone’s “School Mistress,” and some few other ludicrous poems,
derive much of their merit from parody.

This taste for parodies was very prevalent with the Grecians, and is a
species of humour which perhaps has been too rarely practised by the
moderns: Cervantes has some passages of this nature in his parodies of
the old chivalric romances; Fielding in some parts of his Tom Jones
and Joseph Andrews, in his burlesque poetical descriptions; and Swift
in his “Battle of Books,” and “Tale of a Tub,” but few writers have
equalled the delicacy and felicity of Pope’s parodies in the “Rape of
the Lock.” Such parodies give refinement to burlesque.

The ancients made a liberal use of it in their satirical comedy, and
sometimes carried it on through an entire work, as in the Menippean
satire, Seneca’s mock _Eloge_ of Claudius, and Lucian in his
Dialogues. There are parodies even in Plato, and an anecdotical one
recorded of this philosopher shows them in their most simple state.
Dissatisfied with his own poetical essays he threw them into the
flames; that is, the sage resolved to sacrifice his verses to the god
of fire; and in repeating that line in Homer where Thetis addresses
Vulcan to implore his aid, the application became a parody, although
it required no other change than the insertion of the philosopher’s
name instead of the goddess’s:[3]

     “Vulcan, arise! ’tis _Plato_ claims thy aid!”

Boileau affords a happy instance of this simple parody. Corneille, in
his Cid, makes one of his personages remark,

     “Pour grands que soient les rois ils sont ce que nous sommes,
      Ils peuvent se tromper comme les autres hommes.”

A slight alteration became a fine parody in Boileau’s “Chapelain
Décoiflé.”

     “Pour grands que soient les rois ils sont ce que nous sommes,
      Ils se trompent _en vers_ comme les autres hommes.”

We find in Athenæus the name of the Inventor of a species of parody
which more immediately engages our notice――DRAMATIC PARODIES. It
appears this inventor was a satirist, so that the lady-critic, whose
opinion we had the honour of noticing, would be warranted by appealing
to its origin to determine the nature of the thing. A dramatic parody,
which produced the greatest effect, was “the Gigantomachia.” as
appears by the only circumstance known of it. Never laughed the
Athenians so heartily as at its representation, for the fatal news of
the deplorable state to which the affairs of the republic were reduced
in Sicily arrived at its first representation――and the Athenians
continued laughing to the end! as the modern Athenians, the volatile
Parisians, might in their national concern of an OPERA COMIQUE. It was
the business of the dramatic parody to turn the solemn tragedy, which
the audience had just seen exhibited, into a farcical comedy; the same
actors who had appeared in magnificent dresses, now returned on the
stage in grotesque habiliments, with odd postures and gestures, while
the story, though the same, was incongruous and ludicrous. The Cyclops
of Euripides is probably the only remaining specimen; for this may be
considered as a parody of the ninth book of the Odyssey――the
adventures of Ulysses in the cave of Polyphemus, where Silenus and a
chorus of satyrs are farcically introduced, to contrast with the grave
narrative of Homer, of the shifts and escape of the cunning man “from
the one-eyed ogre.” The jokes are too coarse for the French taste of
Brumoy, who, in his translation, goes on with a critical growl and
foolish apology for Euripides having written a farce; Brumoy, like
Pistol, is forced to eat his onion, but with a worse grace, swallowing
and execrating to the end.

In dramatic composition, Aristophanes is perpetually hooking in
parodies of Euripides, whom of all poets he hated, as well as of
Æschylus, Sophocles, and other tragic bards. Since that Grecian wit,
at length, has found a translator saturated with his genius, and an
interpreter as philosophical, the subject of Grecian parody will
probably be reflected in a clearer light from his researches.

Dramatic parodies in modern literature were introduced by our
vivacious neighbours, and may be said to constitute a class of
literary satires peculiar to the French nation. What had occurred in
Greece a similar gaiety of national genius unconsciously reproduced.
The dramatic parodies in our own literature, as in “The Rehearsal,”
“Tom Thumb,” and “The Critic,” however exquisite, are confined to
particular passages, and are not grafted on a whole original; we have
neither naturalised the dramatic parody into a species, nor dedicated
to it the honours of a separate theatre.

This peculiar dramatic satire, a burlesque of an entire tragedy, the
volatile genius of the Parisians accomplished. Whenever a new tragedy,
which still continues the favourite species of drama with the French,
attracted the notice of the town, shortly after up rose its parody at
the Italian theatre. A French tragedy is most susceptible of this sort
of ridicule, by applying its declamatory style, its exaggerated
sentiments, and its romantic out-of-the-way nature to the commonplace
incidents and persons of domestic life; out of the stuff of which they
made their emperors, their heroes, and their princesses, they cut out
a pompous country justice, a hectoring tailor, or an impudent
mantua-maker; but it was not merely this travesty of great personages,
nor the lofty effusions of one in a lowly station, which terminated
the object of parody; it intended a better object, that of more
obviously exposing the original for any absurdity in its scenes, or in
its catastrophe, and dissecting faulty characters; in a word,
critically weighing the nonsense of the poet. It sometimes became a
refined instructor for the public, whose discernment is often blinded
by party or prejudice. It was, too, a severe touch-stone for genius:
Racine, some say, smiled, others say he did not, when he witnessed
Harlequin, in the language of Titus to Berenice, declaiming on some
ludicrous affair to Columbine; La Motte was very sore, and Voltaire
and others shrunk away with a cry――from a parody! Voltaire was angry
when he witnessed his _Mariamne_ parodied by _La mauvaise Mênage_; or
“Bad House-keeping:” the aged, jealous Herod was turned into an old
cross country justice; Varus, bewitched by Mariamne, strutted a
dragoon; and the whole establishment showed it was under very bad
management. Fuzelier collected some of these parodies,[4] and not
unskilfully defends their nature and their object against the protest
of La Motte, whose tragedies had severely suffered from these
burlesques. His celebrated domestic tragedy of Inez de Castro, the
fable of which turns on a concealed and clandestine marriage, produced
one of the happiest parodies in _Agnes de Chaillot_. In the parody the
cause of the mysterious obstinacy of Pierrot the son, in persisting to
refuse the hand of the daughter of his mother-in-law Madame _la
Baillive_, is thus discovered by her to Monsieur _le Baillif_:――

     “Mon mari, pour le coup j’ai découvert l’affaire,
      Ne vous étonnez plus qu’à nos désirs contraire,
      Pour ma fille, Pierrot, ne montre que mépris:
      Voilà l’unique objet dont son cœur est épris.”
                               (_Pointing to Agnes de Chaillot._
The Baillif exclaims,

                        “Ma servante?”

This single word was the most lively and fatal criticism of the tragic
action of Inez de Castro, which, according to the conventional decorum
and fastidious code of French criticism, grossly violated the majesty
of Melpomene, by giving a motive and an object so totally undignified
to the tragic tale. In the parody there was something ludicrous when
the secret came out which explained poor Pierrot’s long concealed
perplexities, in the maid-servant bringing forward a whole legitimate
family of her own! La Motte was also galled by a projected parody of
his “Machabees”――where the hasty marriage of the young Machabeus, and
the sudden conversion of the amorous Antigone, who, for her first
penitential act, persuades a youth to marry her, without first
deigning to consult her respectable mother, would have produced an
excellent scene for the parody. But La Motte prefixed an angry preface
to his Inez de Castro; he inveighs against all parodies, which he
asserts to be merely a French fashion (we have seen, however, that it
was once Grecian), the offspring of a dangerous spirit of ridicule,
and the malicious amusement of superficial minds.――“Were this true,”
retorts Fuzelier, “we ought to detest parodies; but we maintain, that
far from converting virtue into a paradox, and degrading truth by
ridicule, PARODY will only strike at what is chimerical and false; it
is not a piece of buffoonery so much as a critical exposition. What do
we parody but the absurdities of dramatic writers, who frequently make
their heroes act against nature, common sense and truth? After all” he
ingeniously adds, “it is the public, not we, who are the authors of
these PARODIES; for they are usually but the echoes of the pit, and we
parodists have only to give a dramatic form to the opinions and
observations we hear. Many tragedies,” Fuzelier, with admirable truth,
observes, “disguise vices into virtues, and PARODIES unmask them.” We
have had tragedies recently which very much required parodies to
expose them, and to shame our inconsiderate audiences, who patronised
these monsters of false passions. The rants and bombast of some of
these might have produced, with little or no alteration of the
inflated originals, “A Modern Rehearsal,” or a new “Tragedy for Warm
Weather.”

Of PARODIES, we may safely approve of their legitimate use, and even
indulge their agreeable maliciousness; while we must still dread that
extraordinary facility to which the public, or rather human nature,
are so prone, as sometimes to laugh at what, at another time, they
would shed tears.

Tragedy is rendered comic or burlesque by altering the _station_ and
_manners_ of the _persons_; and the reverse may occur, of raising what
is comic and burlesque into tragedy. On so little depends the sublime
or the ridiculous! Beattie says “In most human characters there are
blemishes, moral, intellectual, or corporeal; by exaggerating which,
to a certain degree, you may form a comic character; as by raising the
virtues, abilities, or external advantages of individuals, you form
epic or tragic characters;” a subject humourously touched upon by
Lloyd, in the prologue to “The Jealous Wife.”

     “Quarrels, upbraidings, jealousies, and spleen,
      Grow too familiar in the comic scene;
      Tinge but the language with heroic chime,
     ’Tis passion, pathos, character sublime.
      What big round words had swell’d the pompous scene,
      A king the husband, and the wife a queen!”
